<p>NB:  fees  may be charged to a beauty seeker by his or her bank related to Glamfame's collection of the Total fees. Glamfame disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>
<p>To proceed a booking, beauty seekers will be asked to provide billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Glamfame's payment provider or to Pay Pal. They agree to pay Glamfame for any confirmed bookings for beauty services in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. Beauty seekers authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either by Glamfame's payment provider, or via Pay Pal.</p>
<p>By using Glamefame's payment providers – Pay Mill  and Pay Pal -  members and users of the website may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Glamfame recommends all its members to carefully read such terms and conditions and <a href="{% url 'privacy' %}">Privacy Policy</a> before using the services. Once beauty seeker's confirmed booking transaction is complete he/she will receive a confirmation email summarizing his/her confirmed booking.</p>
<h2>Booking and Financial Principles</h2>
<h3>Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
<p>When a beauty seeker decides to cancel requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by  the beauty service provider, Glamfame will cancel any pre-authorization to the beauty seeker's credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to his/her credit card in connection with the requested booking within technically reasonable time.</p>
<p>When a beauty seeker decides to cancel a confirmed booking made via the website prior to the appointment, he/she will get a refund in accordance with the cancellation policy of the beauty service provider contained in the applicable Listing. Glamfame's ability to pay a refund for confirmed bookings depends upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Cancellation policies of beauty service providers can be found within each listing. The Glamfame Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the beauty service provider.</p>
<p>When a beauty service provider cancels a confirmed booking made via Glamfame, Glamfame will:1) refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable beauty seeker within a technically reasonable time of the cancellation and  (2) will send him/her an email with alternative Listings and other related information. In this case, if the beauty seeker decides to book a listing from the alternative Listings and the corresponding beauty service provider with such alternative Listing confirms the requested booking, then the beauty seeker agrees to pay Glamfame the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking of the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms (this service is still unavailable).</p>
<p><b>In case a beauty service provider cancels a confirmed booking and the corresponding beauty seeker hasn't received an email with alternatives, he/she has to send a notification to: <a href="mailto:admin@glamfame.com?Subject=Hi%20team" target="_top">admin@glamfame.com</a></b></p>
<p>When a beauty service provider cancels a confirmed booking, his cancellation rate will augment and this may result in negative impact among beauty seekers.</p>
<p>In certain force majeure circumstances, Glamfame preserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel a confirmed booking made via the website and disregard the cancellation policy for such booking.</p>
<h2>Rounding Off</h2>
<p>Glamfame preserves the right, in its sole discretion, to round up or round down non-integer amounts that are payable from or to beauty seekers or beauty service providers to the nearest whole functional base unit in the corresponding currency.  Example: we will round up an amount of $99.50 to $100.00, and $91.49 to $91.00.</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.</p>
